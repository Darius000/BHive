# BHive Editor
BHive is a work in progress game engine that was created orginally for learning purposes but since its been started a ton of features were implemented because of how fun it is to program an entire rgram that could be useful in the feature, originally started following Yan Chernikov (TheCherno) on youtube and **learnopengl.com** but the program has ventured out and gone beyond what i learned and with help from the programming community as well, the project has come a long way so far. IT uses other external libraries as well such as ImGizmo, Imgui, Assmip , and STBI Image.
